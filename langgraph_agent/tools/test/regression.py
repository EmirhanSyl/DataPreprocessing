    Perform a basic linear regression to model the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable.

    Parameters:
    - independent_column (str): Name of the independent variable (predictor).

    Returns:
    - dict: Contains regression coefficients, p-values, R-squared value, and a conclusion based on the model fit.

    Perform a hierarchical regression where independent variables are entered in blocks to assess the incremental value of each block.

    Parameters:
    - blocks (list): A list of lists, where each inner list represents a block of independent variables to be entered into the regression model in steps.
    - dependent_column (str): Name of the dependent variable (outcome).

    Returns:
    - dict: Contains regression coefficients for each step, p-values, R-squared values for each step, change in R-squared, and a conclusion on the added value of each block.

    Perform a logistic regression to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables.

    - independent_columns (list): List of independent variable names (predictors).
