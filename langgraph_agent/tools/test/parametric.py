    Perform an independent t-test between two independent columns (samples).

    Parameters:
    - column1 (str): Name of the first column (sample 1).
    - column2 (str): Name of the second column (sample 2).
    - equal_var (bool): Assumes equal variance if True, otherwise performs Welchâ€™s t-test. Default is True.
    - alternative (str): Defines the alternative hypothesis ('two-sided', 'less', 'greater'). Default is 'two-sided'.

    Returns:
    - dict: Contains the t statistic, p-value, and a conclusion based on the hypothesis.

    - column1 (str): Name of the first column (paired sample 1).
