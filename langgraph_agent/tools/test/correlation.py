    Calculate the correlation between two variables.

    Parameters:
    - column1 (str): Name of the first variable.
    - column2 (str): Name of the second variable.
    - method (str): Type of correlation ('pearson', 'spearman', or 'kendall'). Default is 'pearson'.

@tool
def partial_correlation(target_column: str, control_columns: list, method: str = 'pearson') -> dict:
    """
    Calculate the partial correlation between the target variable and other variables, controlling for the effect of additional variables.

    Parameters:
    - target_column (str): Name of the target variable.
    - control_columns (list): List of variable names to control for.
    - method (str): Type of correlation ('pearson', 'spearman', or 'kendall'). Default is 'pearson'.

    Perform a chi-square test of independence to determine if there is a relationship between two categorical variables.

    Parameters:
    - column1 (str): Name of the first categorical variable.
    - column2 (str): Name of the second categorical variable.

    Returns:
    - dict: Contains the chi-square statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, and a conclusion on the association between the variables.

@tool
def reliability_analysis(items_columns: list) -> dict:
    """
    Perform a reliability analysis (typically using Cronbach's Alpha) to assess the internal consistency of a set of items.

    Parameters:
    - items_columns (list): List of item/variable names to assess internal consistency (e.g., survey or test items).

    Returns:
    - dict: Contains Cronbach's Alpha value, item-total correlations, and a conclusion on the reliability of the scale.

def exploratory_factor_analysis(columns: list, n_factors: int, method: str = 'principal', rotation: str = 'varimax') -> dict:
    """
    Perform exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify underlying relationships between measured variables.

    Parameters:
    - columns (list): List of variable names to be included in the factor analysis.
    - n_factors (int): Number of factors to extract.
    - method (str): Extraction method ('principal' for Principal Axis Factoring, 'maximum_likelihood', etc.). Default is 'principal'.
    - rotation (str): Rotation method ('varimax', 'promax', etc.). Default is 'varimax'.

    Returns:
    - dict: Contains factor loadings, explained variance, communalities, and a conclusion on the underlying structure of the data.
